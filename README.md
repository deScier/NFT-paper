# Scientific Paper NFT ðŸ“š

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract for creating and managing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing scientific papers. The contract is built using the Ethereum blockchain and leverages the OpenZeppelin ERC721 and Ownable contracts to ensure a secure and standard-compliant implementation.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- Utilizes IPFS for decentralized storage of scientific papers.
- Enables submission, review, and approval of scientific papers in a decentralized manner.
- Mints unique NFTs for each approved paper.
- Utilizes OpenZeppelin ERC721 and Ownable contracts for secure implementation.

## ðŸ“œ Contract Overview

The `ScientificPaperNFT` contract defines a `Paper` struct that holds essential details, such as:

- IPFS hash for decentralized paper storage
- Editor's Ethereum address
- Two revisor Ethereum addresses
- Counter for tracking received approvals

The contract allows the contract owner to submit a new paper, which creates a new `Paper` struct and emits a `PaperSubmitted` event. Revisors or the editor can approve a paper, and once a paper receives two approvals, an NFT is minted for that paper. The contract uses events to track and notify users about paper submissions and approvals.
